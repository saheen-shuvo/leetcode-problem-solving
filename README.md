# 🧩 LeetCode Problem Solving

Welcome to my **battlefield diary** against LeetCode puzzles!  
This repo is where bugs cry, compilers rage, and I eventually earn those sweet green checkmarks ✅.

## 🚀 About
- A collection of solved LeetCode problems (with sweat, coffee, and countless debug sessions ☕🔥).  
- Each file = one mini victory against brain-melting logic.  
- Some problems fell in minutes ⚔️, others took *long debates with the compiler*.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Sharpen problem-solving skills 🧠  
- Practice clean and efficient code ✨  
- Collect green ticks like Pokémon 🟢  

---

## 📂 Structure
Problems are organized by:
- Problem name / number  
- Solution language (mostly C++ for now)  

---

## 😂 Fun Fact
LeetCode problems: **many**  
My sanity: **still loading…**
